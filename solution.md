## Solution Description ##
Goal of the problem is to take two integers as input, calculate, and print the sum and difference. Sum is computed by adding the two numbers, while difference is computed by substracting the second number from the first number.

## Code Explanation ##
1. Take two integers from user
2. Do addition A+B, do substraction A-B
3. Print out both results

## Alternative Solution ##
Use loops with increment (++) and decrement (--) operations.
- Addition: using while loop, increment A by 1 and decrement B by 1 until B reaches 0.
- Substraction: using while loop, decrement A by 1 and decrement B by 1 until B reaches 0.

Then print out both results.
